## Kushal Krishnappa
Hi! I am a software engineer with 2+ years of experience in Platform Engineering at Pure Storage. Currently open for Spring/Summer 2026 Internships focused on backend systems, automation, internal tooling, and AI/cloud/on-prem infrastructure. 

### Here are some things I am good at:
- Design and work on projects solely with complete ownership and SDLC practices.
- Collaborate with team for brainstorming solutions and project planning.
- I love to write code and go crazy for solving engineering problems at scale.

### Some things I am doing:
- Learning OS in depth. If you ask why, check this out: [Dominator](https://github.com/Cloud-Foundations/Dominator) and [DMTCP](https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp)
- I've developed interest in GPU Architecture recently and exploring more on GPU Performance Optimization. If you are intereted in this topic I am open for discussion.
